# Indian Stock Market Trading Helper Tool

An attempt to make something useful for trading in the stock market. Let's see how far I can make it. (NSE only)

## Features

* Sends messages when the levels set by you for average and current price cross.

## To do

### Since, the project deals with realtime data, speed of the servers is highly important. Do not add bloatware! 

- [ ] To add a front-end (preferably with react or vue.)
- [ ] To add a back-end (prefereably flask, but nodejs or django can also be used.)
- [ ] The **main.py** in **pyScript** folder should run concurrently with the server. (Have to send the datapacket.json or datapacket from the python script to the frontend as a response. So, the frontend can update whenever it receives new data.) 
- [ ] To get notifications on level hit. (To be handled in the frontend)
- [ ] Add BSE support
